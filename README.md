# Fictitious-play-in-cake-cutting
Simulation of the fictitious play dynamic in cake cutting. Specifically, we have the following repeated game:
- In each round, a cake arrives (which is identical to the one in the previous round).
- Alice cuts the cake at some point of her choice and Bob simultaneously declares Left/Right to indicate what piece he wants; Alice will take the piece Bob did not choose.
- In fictitious play, each player best responds to the distribution of actions of the other player.
